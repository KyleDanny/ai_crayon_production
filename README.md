## Feedback

### Pros of Using AI for Code

- Fast: Gets you started quickly with boilerplate code.

- Helpful: Explains stuff and suggests fixes.

- Less Errors: Follows best practices, so fewer mistakes.

- Customizable: Tailors code to your needs (e.g., Mac setup, crayon business).

- Always Available: Helps anytime, even when humans canâ€™t.

### Cons of Using AI for Code

- Not Perfect: Can give incomplete or buggy solutions (like your rendering issue).

- Debugging Hassle: Fixing AIâ€™s mistakes can take extra time.

- Generic: Doesnâ€™t always "get" your specific problem.

- Prompt-Dependent: Needs clear instructions to work well.

- Time Sink: Tweaking and debugging can eat up time.

- No Creativity: Struggles with unique or creative solutions.

### Your Experience

- Good: AI saved time setting up Django and gave debugging tips.

- Not So Good: The rendering issue took extra effort to fix.

### When to Use AI

For quick setups, learning, or standard tasks.

Not for super complex or unique problems.

### Takeaway

AIâ€™s great for speeding things up and learning, but always double-check its work and use your own skills for the tricky stuff. ðŸ˜Š
